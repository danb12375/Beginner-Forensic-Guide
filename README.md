# Beginner-Forensic-Guide
My university final project allowed me to answer the question ‘It is feasible for a novice to conduct a Windows 10 Forensic investigation within a 6-month timeframe using open-source tools?’. This was done by creating a VM environment with open-source tools alongside a 7-chapter step by step guide of how to complete a forensic investigation covering areas such as forensic imaging, live acquisition, hash analysis, file system, browser and recycle bin forensics alongside chain of custody to document the findings. The 7 chapters are all available to view.
